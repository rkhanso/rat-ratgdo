# Single-sided Eagle files

Download files above and open in Eagle to make your own single-sided PCBs at home.

PCB is proven to work (I'm using it on my Chamberlain garage door).

My schematic/board uses a 2n7000 and a RFP30N06LE.

Controller is a generic ESP8266 D1 Mini.

There is only one 3-pin screw connector. Why do you need anything more?

No extra dry contacts or anything. Just use this in Home Assistant and you'll be fine.
